# Tst fall database loader + classifier for skeletons
Just created this repository for my own sake to keep the work organized.

## install? no install
this is matlab code. to load the databases in a different way you need to download the TST fall database v2 from the website

##use
with a kinect for windows, the matlab code should just output a 1 if the person is detected to be falling. I have an XBOX 360 sensor, so I havent`t checked if this is working
